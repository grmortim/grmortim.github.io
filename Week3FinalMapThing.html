    <p class="opacity"><i>A Look at Public Art in Toronto</i></p>
    <p class="justify"> Have you ever driven by cool and "neat" art while driving through Toronto? Have you been unable to just go walking around 
        and check out cool art? are you concerned with a high level of physical activity due to heart complications? If you 
        answered yes to all three of these questions then this map is geared towards you! This will be a handy reference of registered, high end hotels in Toronto,
        where public art instiallations can be found, and in the case of an emergency where the closest AED will be kept (as of 2020). Happy art hunting!
